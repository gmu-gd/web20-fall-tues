    <h4> Project 1: Linking Narratives </h4>
    <p class="description"> The structure of a website is as equally important as the design of a website. Getting from page X to page Y needs to be intuitive and simple. This structure also needs to be reflected on the back end. Create a site that takes the user through a narrative using text, links, and multiple pages. </p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>

  <article class="single" id="e5">
    <h4 id="e5-wireframes">E5: Wireframes</h4>

<p>Create two wireframes for the home page of the site you used for your site map. The first wireframe should be created from the site as it looks on your computer (desktop size). The second wireframe should be created from the site as it looks on your phone (mobile size). You can create both of them sketched on paper, both digitally, or one of each.</p>

<p>Upload your wireframes to your site and include a link to the website you made the site map for.</p>

<h5 id="requirements">Requirements:</h5>

<ul>
  <li>A desktop wireframe</li>
  <li>A mobile wireframe</li>
  <li>Two image files on your website</li>
</ul>

    <h4 id="e4-site-map">E4: Site Map</h4>

<p>Create a site map showing the structure and organization of a website. Also include who you think the intended audience is and what the main action or actions the site is hoping a user will accomplish. The site needs to be more than a few pages. It should multiple levels of information across multiple pages. You can create your site map in any software you choose but it needs to be done digitally. My recommendation would be to use Xd.</p>

<p>Upload a PNG of your final site map to your site and include a link to the website you made the site map for.</p>

<h5 id="requirements">Requirements:</h5>

<ul>
  <li>URL for your website</li>
  <li>Site’s intended audience</li>
  <li>Site’s primary action for the user</li>
  <li>PNG of your digital site map on your site</li>
</ul>

    <h4 id="e3-organization-and-naming">E3: Organization and Naming</h4>

<p>File naming and organization are important parts of making sure your files are easy to find both visually and while writing links. Download this zip file and you will find there is a simple site with a terrible file structure. Rename these files something clear and simple and then organize them into a nice folder structure. The site has a main page and then 3 sub pages for an about page, a menus page, and a gallery page.</p>

<p>Once you have organized and renamed the files, take a screenshot of the new structure and post it to your site (Atom’s sidebar is a great view). If you cannot get a view where all the files and folders are shown in one folder, take multiple screenshots or position multiple folders on the screen to show the structure.</p>

<h5 id="requirements">Requirements:</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Folders and files appropriately named</li>
  <li>Folders and files appropriately organized</li>
  <li>Screenshot(s) of folder and file structure and names on your site</li>
</ul>

    <h4 id="exercise-2-make-the-grid">Exercise 2: Make the Grid</h4>

<p>Using XD or other approved design software make 5 artboards that are 1440 pixels wide by 3000 pixels tall. On each artboard create a grid that could be used to layout a website. The grid does not need rows, only columns. Once you have 5 different grids start adding some “content” to your pages. The content should be shapes (squares, rectangles, circles) that could represent images, icons, text, etc. Some shapes should be tall, some shapes should be short, some should be wide, and some should be narrow. The grid should be your guide for how your shapes line up and fit on the page. Do not ignore the grid. Keep in mind ideas about space and that every pixel of the page does not need to be filled. If you need a little help starting, check out the <a href="/tutorials/2-point-1">2.1 tutorial</a>.</p>

<h5 id="requirements">Requirements</h5>

<ul>
  <li>5 png files at 1440px wide by 3000px tall</li>
  <li>Layouts use only shapes</li>
  <li>Layouts use different grids</li>
</ul>

    <h4 id="exercise-1-20-questions">Exercise 1: 20 Questions</h4>

<p>Read through each discussion post from your classmates and create a web page that answers each question asked. That means you will answer 20 questions total — 19 of your classmates questions plus one of your own. The page will be simple and use default styles but should display the question and your answer in a clear way. If you need a little help starting, check out the <a href="/tutorials/1-point-1">1.2 tutorial</a>.</p>

<h5 id="requirements">Requirements</h5>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">title</code> element with relevant content</li>
  <li>a page title using a heading element</li>
  <li>20 questions and answers</li>
</ul>
